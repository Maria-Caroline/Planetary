# About the Project
Welcome to my Card Game project, a labor of love where I wear both the developer and illustrator hats. Drawing inspiration from the beloved game "Super Trunfo," players engage in strategic battles by selecting attributes unique to each card.

The project's website unfolds across three captivating pages:

## Planetary
Embark on a celestial journey as you explore the main characters of this fictional universe. Click on any celestial body in the solar system to unveil a concise yet vivid description accompanied by an illustrative masterpiece.

## Tales
Delve deeper into the lore of the characters you've encountered. A simple click on a constellation unveils the intricately woven stories linked to it, inviting users to immerse themselves in captivating narratives.

## Game
The crown jewel of the project, the gaming page, awaits your exploration. Discover the simplicity of the game: select a card from your deck, choose an attribute, and witness the system unveil the opponent's card. The excitement peaks as the winner is revealed, claiming a card from the loser's deck. The game concludes when either the opponent's or the player's deck is depleted, proudly displaying the overall winner along with a final score. Ready to embark on this thrilling card game adventure?
